[[embedded-json]]
=== Embedded JSON datatype

By default, each subfield in an object is mapped and indexed separately. If
the names or types of the subfields are not known in advance, then they are
<<dynamic-mapping, mapped dynamically>>.

The `embedded_json` type provides an alternative approach, where the entire object is
mapped as a single field. Given an object, the `embedded_json` mapping will parse out
its leaf values and index them into one field. The object's contents can then
be searched through simple keyword-style queries.

This data type can be useful for indexing objects with a very large number of
distinct keys. Compared to mapping each field separately, embedded JSON fields have
the following advantages:

- Only one field mapping is created for the whole object, which can help
  prevent a <<mapping-limit-settings, mappings explosion>> due to a large
  number of field mappings.
- An embedded JSON field may take up less space in the index, as only one underlying
  field is created.

However, embedded JSON fields present a trade-off in terms of search functionality.
Only basic queries are allowed, with no support for numeric range queries or
highlighting. Further information on the limitations can be found in the
<<supported-operations, Supported operations>> section.

NOTE: The `embedded_json` mapping type should **not** be used for indexing all JSON
content, as it provides only limited search functionality. The default
approach, where each subfield has its own entry in the mappings, works well in
the majority of cases.

An embedded JSON field can be created as follows:
[source,js]
--------------------------------
PUT bug_reports
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "labels": {
        "type": "embedded_json"
      }
    }
  }
}

POST bug_reports/_doc/1
{
  "title": "Results are not sorted correctly.",
  "labels": {
    "priority": "urgent",
    "release": ["v1.2.5", "v1.3.0"],
    "timestamp": {
      "created": 1541458026,
      "closed": 1541457010
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TESTSETUP

During indexing, tokens are created for each leaf value in the JSON object. The
values are indexed as string keywords, without analysis or special handling for
numbers or dates.

Querying the top-level `embedded_json` field searches all leaf values in the object:
[source,js]
--------------------------------
POST bug_reports/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {"labels": "urgent"}
  }
}
--------------------------------
// CONSOLE

To query on a specific key in the JSON object, object dot notation is used:
[source,js]
--------------------------------
POST bug_reports/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {"labels.release": "v1.3.0"}
  }
}
--------------------------------
// CONSOLE

[[supported-operations]]
==== Supported operations

Currently, embedded JSON fields can be used with the following query types:

- `term`, `terms`, and `terms_set`
- `prefix`
- `range`
- `match` and `multi_match`
- `query_string` and `simple_query_string`
- `exists`

When querying, it is not possible to refer to field keys using wildcards, as in
`{ "term": {"labels.time*": 1541457010}}`. Note that all queries, including
`range`, treat the values as string keywords. Highlighting is not supported on
`json` fields.

It is possible to sort on an embedded JSON field, as well as perform simple
keyword-style aggregations such as `terms`. As with queries, there is no
special support for numerics -- all values in the JSON object are treated as
keywords. When sorting, this implies that values are compared lexicographically.

[[stored-fields]]
==== Stored fields

If the <<mapping-store,`store`>> option is enabled, the entire JSON object will
be stored in pretty-printed format. It can be retrieved through the top-level
`embedded_json` field:

[source,js]
--------------------------------
POST bug_reports/_search
{
  "query": { "match": { "title": "results not sorted" }},
  "stored_fields": ["labels"]
}
--------------------------------
// CONSOLE

Field keys cannot be used to load stored content. For example, specifying
`"stored_fields": ["labels.timestamp"]` will return an empty list.

[[json-params]]
==== Parameters for JSON fields

Because of the similarities in the way values are indexed, the `embedded_json` type
shares many mapping options with <<keyword, `keyword`>>. The following
parameters are accepted:

[horizontal]

<<mapping-boost,`boost`>>::

    Mapping field-level query time boosting. Accepts a floating point number,
    defaults to `1.0`.

`depth_limit`::

    The maximum allowed depth of the JSON field, in terms of nested inner
    objects. If a JSON field exceeds this limit, then an error will be
    thrown. Defaults to `20`.

<<doc-values,`doc_values`>>::

    Should the field be stored on disk in a column-stride fashion, so that it
    can later be used for sorting, aggregations, or scripting? Accepts `true`
    (default) or `false`.

<<eager-global-ordinals,`eager_global_ordinals`>>::

    Should global ordinals be loaded eagerly on refresh? Accepts `true` or `false`
    (default). Enabling this is a good idea on fields that are frequently used for
    terms aggregations.

<<ignore-above,`ignore_above`>>::

    Leaf values longer than this limit will not be indexed. By default, there
    is no limit and all values will be indexed. Note that this limit applies
    to the leaf values within the JSON field, and not the length of the entire
    field.

<<mapping-index,`index`>>::

    Determines if the field should be searchable. Accepts `true` (default) or
    `false`.

<<index-options,`index_options`>>::

    What information should be stored in the index for scoring purposes.
    Defaults to `docs` but can also be set to `freqs` to take term frequency
    into account when computing scores.

<<null-value,`null_value`>>::

    A string value which is substituted for any explicit `null` values within
    the JSON field. Defaults to `null`, which means null sfields are treated as
    if it were missing.

<<similarity,`similarity`>>::

    Which scoring algorithm or _similarity_ should be used. Defaults
    to `BM25`.

`split_queries_on_whitespace`::

    Whether <<full-text-queries,full text queries>> should split the input on
    whitespace when building a query for this field. Accepts `true` or `false`
    (default).

<<mapping-store,`store`>>::

    Whether the field value should be stored and retrievable separately from
    the <<mapping-source-field,`_source`>> field. Accepts `true` or `false`
    (default).
